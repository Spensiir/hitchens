things are just the way they are.

that sentence can end all discussions, past and future.

things are as they are they will continue to be so for all of time. we may feel like we are driving, but we are passengers.

yet biology seems to have his desires anyways. 

i don't like how i feel right now. i feel separated from connection. yet i fear connection. i fear closeness. it is both unfamiliar and triggers deep wounds. 

neglect told me "there is no one even when you need help"

abuse told me "if there is someone they will be violent"

i no longer see my parents as villains. just flawed humans who tried their best. i no longer see myself as undeserving of loving attention or deserving of violence and suffering. just a flawed human trying his best. i no longer see society as a vengeful creature. instead i see a reflection of my own humanity. it is struggling with an explosion of human connection. for the first time in recorded history, we know of one another on a global scale. we do not know what to make of this. 

our biology is stuttering. our minds are stretching. our technology is sprinting forward. 

and i feel so lonely. home. underemployed and confused. do i want just another job? where i feel exploited but occupied and enveloped in some sense of community. it would give me money. 

oh money. what a word. what an idea. how badly we yearn feel financially safe and what we lose in pursuit.

my parents didn't model behavior that valued relationships. i think it really affected me. even though the environment they raised me in lacked emotional nourishment it was never lacking in commitment to physical health. i think what my family was missing was community. for a long time i could not even begin to see the impact lack of community can have on family health and subsequently, a child's health. 

where am i now ? home, in my parents home. alone. i spent the whole day alone. it felt familiar and safe yet by the afternoon the emptiness started to close in on me. confusion set in. i dont want to feel the pain so i'm writing. where usually, i would descend into a spiral; questioning the meaning of everything. 

but it makes sense why i feel so much despair. because this was a cycle i born into. and the cycle feels deeply unnatural. unnourishing. yet it was the water i was plopped into from the moment i started developing. I guess aside from my first two years in china. 

it's so cold. but safe. safe. safe. i still want to feel safe. i know you want more but please i cannot jeopardize a sense of safety. control. i can control everything when i am alone. i have no idea whats out there! even with people i know i cant predict them. i dont want to put forth so much energy in defense mode so i can exist around people in safety. 

and this fucking environment doesnt help. no family. no extended family. no family. no more friends. my found family left me. they all left. this modern world is bleeding me dry. it's draining the atmosphere i need to survive. 

suburbia. no third place. it's all stacked against me. but it feels safe safe safe safe safe safe. i need to talk to my therapist about this. someone about this but no. that's the most terrifying thing of all.

no one talks about this. if we talk about than we admit that we've been living in pain all this time. and so many of those around me weaved a web that works somehow maybe because their families lived her a lot longer than mine. so they wont understand and that would hurt so much more. they would look at me blankly and say "what the hell are you talking about? be grateful. life has been hard to me too and i still find a way to give back and be happy. be grateful you little brat"

maybe they're right. that's the core of my fear. maybe they're right. i am ungrateful. i am suffering because i am ungrateful. i just refuse to suck it up and do the work and accept reality and be happy with what i fucking have. 

but im trying to accept reality. my reality. not someone elses. my reality or the reality my flawed parents shunted onto me with their cruel words. "you lazy bug" in chinese. it hurt. "old man" "i suffered so much more than you, what right do you have to complain?" 

maybe they're right. no. they're aren't wrong either. they're neither. they're just saying shit. and it affected you. and now you have resistance to those deeply internalized stories about yourself and your right to complain and try to change the course of your life. 

It's tricky because those same people are giving you a place to live right now and a car to use. So it's hard to exit their story when you are relying on them for basic needs. 

this is the loop. we will always need someone who basic needs. if not them, then perhaps a job that i have yet to be able to tolerate. if not that then carliving or wooffing or travel jobs or a mix of it all. 

it's so hard to think about this stuff because behind all of it is the sorrow that i have to try and figure it out all on my own. i know i technically dont have to and maybe there are people out there who can help me but i REALLY struggle with mustering up the courage to ask for it. OKAY. its how it is for me right now. It's how it is. it is how i feel right now. im not sorry. i am not sorry. i am open to change but not drastic ok. 

i am building a relationship with my therapist. i think i want to go back to seeing her every week but ill keep things as they are for now. the point is. i have help. my parents almost definitely won't kick me out or take away my access to the car.

i am getting to a point where i am finding myself generally less anxious and more capable of being where i am. there is a challenge in front of me. it is real. it is massive. i will need help. it is all connected. it is not just money. it is not just a painful history. it is not just a lack of community. it is not just growing up an ethnic minority. it is not just the world changing rapidly. it is not just undernourishment. it is all of it together. sometimes one more than all the others. other times it's everything all at once. sometimes it's quiet.

right now. i'm going to see a friend and play volleyball.
