things are just the way they are.

that sentence can end all discussions, past and future.

things are as they are they will continue to be so for all of time. we may feel like we are driving, but we are passengers.

yet biology seems to have his desires anyways. 

i don't like how i feel right now. i feel separated from connection. yet i fear connection. i fear closeness. it is both unfamiliar and triggers deep wounds. 

neglect told me "there is no one even when you need help"

abuse told me "if there is someone they will be violent"

i no longer see my parents as villains. just flawed humans who tried their best. i no longer see myself as undeserving of loving attention or deserving of violence and suffering. just a flawed human trying his best. i no longer see society as a vengeful creature. instead i see a reflection of my own humanity. it is struggling with an explosion of human connection. for the first time in recorded history, we know of one another on a global scale. we do not know what to make of this. 

our biology is stuttering. our minds are stretching. our technology is sprinting forward.
