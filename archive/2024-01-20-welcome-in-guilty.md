i feel confused because
my parents did not get enough nurture
and as a result could not nurture me enough
which leads me to the being i am today
so full of holes
yearning for nurture
attention
healing
from my parents
who did not get enough nurture

and just earlier i told my mom she manipulates me into doing what she wants
which is true
but i feel bad because
she would do better if she could
she would ask if she felt safe enough to
if it were modeled well for her

but it wasn't fair for me either
to receive the poison she was exposed to
from her upbringing

this is not to mention the fuckery
that comes with raising a child in a foreign world
without the aid of family 
and outside the comfort of culture

i just want attention at the end of the day
and i didnt get it for so long that 
its so easy for me to feel angry
every time i go through something difficult
and my parents make no effort to help me through it
and even if i did put it on their radars
they would give empty advice 
instead of
inquiring and leading me through my challenges

it all just feels like a cruel joke
because their best wasn't enough
and i feel guilty for teling them the things they did were wrong
i feel it right now
i do
i feel it

i wish there was enough nourishment 
for all of us
i wish
my parents weren't born in the wake
of the great famine
in the midst of so much turmoil and suffering

my dad is so disconnected from his body
he cannot understand pain 
so he cannot understand joy
he lives in between the lines
of stagnant "wisdoms"
because he has nothing else

he offers me a place to stay
a car 
food here and there

it's a lot compared to what he got
it's complicated
i don't want to get too deep into it

i kind of broke up with someone today
he likes me a lot
or at least the idea of me 
i'm not sure
it feels so good
in a way
to be wanted so passionately
and to be told so
because my parents didn't make me feel that way
no one did 

and it seems like a romantic partner can fill that hole
but i dont like him back like that
im not sure i can like anyone who likes me a lot
because ive yet to tend to my garden
enough

im working on it
im trying
im still wrapped in love
but im not sure i understand that kind of love
if im ready for that
before i understand 
the love of a parent

which is so hard to get
or to know how it should go
it's faith in my body
that it could be better
so much better
faith and faith alone

that i can have an inner voice
that loves everything that arises in my body
and wants to see it all

my mom is a mother 
she wants her kid to live and succeed
she's haunted by her past
i think
she didn't get therapy
but she had time to think
every day on the bus 
back and forth to and from
work

but so much work
so much repetition
is she growing?
was she meant to grow in the way
that i am meant to?

i think experiencing a childhood
abused
and neglected
and shamed for feeling so
is a bomb of confusion

life needs a lot
new life needs more
when those needs are not met
there is an ocean of pain

there is a river of doubt 
that my natural needs
should even be seen

there is anger
volcanic
stored deep 
suffocated
repressed
twisted
trapped like bubbles underneath
plastic film

there is guilt
an atmosphere of shame
needs unmet must mean i deserve to be left to dry

but then there
is 
raw
sorrow

raw
pain

raw yearning

raw moment

raw stinging burning frustration
raw
raw
raw
raw
raw
raw

just sensation
tightness in the throat 
again and this time
welcome
welcome
welcome
welcome
welcome
welcome
welcome
welcome
welcome
welcome
all welcome
guilt
confusion
anger
halfway
halfway
uncertain
in between
traveling
welcome you too
are welcome
welcome in welcome in welcome in welcome
in
tight throat
tight throat breathe
tight throat 
frustration no words
no words grumble growl
no words growl
welcome in welcome in welcome in 
hello tell me about yourself ill be quiet

good night
