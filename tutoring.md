### background
As an honors graduate of Georgia Tech with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Psychology, I took many challenging math classes while studying how the human mind learns. 

I didn't know it at the time, but my college experience set me up to be a highly effective math tutor. 
### philosophy
I believe students learn best through careful scaffolding, plentiful positive encouragement, and consistent access to a knowledgeable human. 

I am looking to offer my skillset to students who are struggling with math concepts through a personalized tutoring service.
