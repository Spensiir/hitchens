energy
intention
peace

these are the dimensions that must align for me to move forward

energy is simple. is there enough fuel to burn?

intention is innate, always there but constantly being obscured by distractions

peace is letting the dirt settle so the water is clear and intention becomes visible

when energy is ample, intention is clear, and peace is cultivated, action can flow easily and movement feels deeply pleasureable

energy depletes, intention becomes obscured by the dirt kicked up in movement, and peace loses focus

the wheel has turned delightfully

a new world is before my eyes
