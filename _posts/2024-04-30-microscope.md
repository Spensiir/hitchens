he is microscope straining to see a mountain range. he wants to know where food and shelter is, and where predators are not. he wants to see the entire mountain range. 

he cannot see it all but he has a mind that pieces together memories into patterns. he can imagine the mountain range. the mind works hard to keep the creature safe. 

one day the mind realizes that it cannot guarantee anything. it panics. its body needs so much.  

he remembers that he is a microscope in a mountain range, trying to see. he sees garlic and he sees coconuts. he sees wool and he sees flesh.

he doesn't want it to end. he cannot stop it from ending. this push and pull has not ended.
