  he feels like a microscope trying to see a mountain range. this might not have bothered him, but his body gets hungry and cold and scared. he wants to know where food and shelter is, and where predators are not. he wants to see the entire mountain range. 

luckily, he has a memory. he even has a mind to piece together memories into patterns to try to predict the future. the mind works hard to provide crucial information to the creature. 

one day the mind realizes that no matter how hard it tries, it cannot guarantee anything. it panics. its body needs so much. warmth, food, safety. how can it relax when nothing can be certainly attained? 

it remembers that he is a microscope in a mountain range, trying to see. he sees sorrow and he sees pain. he sees joy and he sees fear. he sees beauty in it all. 

he doesn't want it to end. he cannot stop it from ending. he tries to enjoy the moment as deeply and as often as possible. but worry creeps in. he feels his body needs things. he must take action to get those things. with every action there is an equal loss of awareness. now, he sees confusion.
