I'm not ready to let go of my self, even while the self is an illusion. It feels too harrowing to plunge into the Vortex, even though I am already a part of it and always will be. Despite it all, I am not ready to neutralize the poision - I cling to it. I am not ready to release my phobia of death and unbearable pain. I am not ready for the bliss of complete acceptance even if such a state is the Truth. I want this creature's story to crawl on - to feel distinct from the Vortex a little longer.
