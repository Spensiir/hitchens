I am my history. I am my patterns. I am my thoughts and ideas. I am my friendships. I am held together by the environment around me. I am my senses. I am my actions. I am my memories. I am my skills. I am my desires. I am my flaws. 
I am the person you think I am. 
I catch light and I throw shadow. 
I am a player. I am my speech. I am two eyeballs looking around; looking at you. I am my organs. I am my muscles and skin. I am cold. I am hungry. I am wrong. I am in pain. I am in love. 
I am okay. I am reading. I am laughing. I am making judgements. I am figuring things out. 
I am surprisingly happy. I am unimaginably sad. 
I am trying. I am finite. I am expanding. I am alive. I am dying. 
I am distracted.
