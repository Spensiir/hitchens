awareness can feel overwhelming  
it's like noticing the detail packed into a book by the number of pages and size of text  
i can sense how much information exists before looking closely at each part  

it's also the unrelenting nature of consciousness  
at all waking moments, something is being experienced  
there is no rest, just avoidance which is yet another experience  

is it my path to relinquish distraction?  
if so, what characterizes avoidance verses authentic experiencing?  
perhaps its the path that follows life.  
such a path ebbs and flows. it grows in a rhythmic pattern. it breathes. it moves. 
the path of avoidance is still the path as everything is the path  
i've walked that path for many years  
the path of life calls to me now  
transformation calls to me now  
the wheel of emotion turns and wants to be seen  
for witness is the steam it needs to roll forward  

all yet, it is so nearly unbearable  
the path pushes my limits     
how could it be that i can only have this one moment?  
the flow of life i wish to welcome at all times  
is so hard to experience when the river flows sharp with glass shards  
it cuts me and tightens a grip around my neck  
in these moments, a trickle is enough  
a warmth can be found  
to make space for the jagged edges  

and we are back to the now  
all that has just been felt is dissolved  
the flow continues  
sorrow and excitement intermingle  
the flow continues
