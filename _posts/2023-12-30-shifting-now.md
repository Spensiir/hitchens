I won't be able to capture the feeling fully but I'll be happy if I can communicate a glimpse.

I am alone right now. In my room. My parents are occupying space in the floor below, silently in the moment.

I feel pressure in my throat. I feel doubt about my current actions. I have a hunch that it has something to do with being alone right now after feeling left alone for year and years. There is this desperate terror that this is my core. Vague and sharp pain accompanied by a bottomless and swirling sense of confusion. Then another part emerges. You'll never feel better if you keep feeling this pain - keep feeling so sorry for yourself. Fight it. That's the only way. But what is it? Who am I suppose to be fighting? I am quite literally completely alone. No. The answer is not to fight myself. It feels like the path forward because fighting would achieve half the goal. It would smother the thread that leads back to the source of the discomfort, and it would offer temporary if incomplete relief. The relief would come at the cost of engaging in some activity with a body-numbing intention. That is this part's solution. Bless his heart he tries so hard to help. Thank you. Not everyone is happy with your approach and they have reason to be upset but thank you for your effort. Can you trust in another approach? One that is showing quite some promise? You feel hurt. 

If the other approach works then what have I been guiding us towards all this time?

The best you could have done and the best we could muster given our circumstances.

Then who am I now? If I let us go your way then what is my role in the future? I want to stay. 

Baby, only time has the full answer but we know this for sure right now. You sense discomfort. You notify us that something is not okay. You lend us strength to move forward towards a better state. You are fire. Fire is power and energy, but it is not in its nature to channel itself with skill. I can help you with that, if you will lend me the fuel. I am iron. I am structure. I am skin.

Back to the pressure in my throat. What's wrong baby?

Am I doing okay? Am I doing it wrong?

No no not at all you're perfect. You are allowed to be at rest. You are allowed to be at rest. You are allowed to sit. You are perfect perfect perfect. 

I'm missing out on the party but I didn't want to go so far especially because I have work tomorrow. 

I hear you baby.

But the others are mad. They wanted to be with everyone else and I told them no. I wish I didn't have to make them upset. 

Breathing you in 
Cradle you in my arms
How long I've left you alone
My sweetest love in this world
I find no fault in what you've done
I am so proud of you
I know the others will understand
I am here for you no matter what

And I assure you your friends will understand too

I'm afraid too. That my friends will think less of me for not coming.
