Discomfort. A creature that stings and bites and screeches. We are born with a gate specifically made for his whims. He comes and goes as often as he likes. 

Sometimes it stays for a full hour and other times for the majority of a day. In the darkest times he makes a nest of my body. 

They say to engage with discomfort like he’s a dragon with a soft heart. Easier said than done. Since life feels good otherwise, discomfort might as well be pure evil. If he simply did not exist, then the line between heaven and earth would cease. You’re asking me to meet him with open arms whenever he makes an appearance?  

Some people believe discomfort is a crucial ingredient for joy. Others see discomfort as a fact of life that at best, can be managed and minimized. 

I tend to lean towards the latter. Okay, fine, discomfort has always been here and will always be here. How do I engage with discomfort? Acceptance? Positive reframing? Distraction? Conversation? Rejection? Denial? Frustration? 

How much of our experience with discomfort is even within our control? I don’t feel like my immediate emotional reaction to discomfort is voluntary. 

I do feel like I have the power to stymie acts of distraction to make space for pure listening. 

It’s in this segment of the decision chain where I, time and time again, come across the same crossroads. Looking discomfort straight in his eyes feels like it demands too much from my attention - energy that could be directed towards more important things like surviving longer in the future. 

There is no halfhearted listening to pain. To hear pain is to allow the counseling session to influence my next decision. It is breaking from the chain of bubbles I have learned to find safety in. 

Deciding to see discomfort throws a wrench in the whole operation. The attention must be calm and clean and warm and strong. It requires valuable resources. Resources that other parts are desperately hoarding to bolster their story of security.

At this point is where I am deciding, literally right now, to take a second leap of faith. I will see my pain whenever it comes up. I will prioritize creating space to fully see and hear discomfort and all his children. 

How to create that space is another question.
