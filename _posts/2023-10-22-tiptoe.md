we do all these things.
chase love. cuddle. hug. cook and eat. organize our spaces. click and type symbols on computers. drink water. design things and build them. chat. learn new concepts. teach those concepts. accept a new job. read books and articles. watch animated films on a screen. make observations and laugh with friends. dream. share dreams. share drinks. share drugs. experience drugs. listen to music. produce music. put stickers on our possessions. think thoughts. change ideas. blow into whistles. jump into the air. sit up straighter. run until our joints ache. inhale cold air. sweat. masturbate. participate in sex. fantasize about sex. imagine worlds. snuggle into our warm beds. whip off the blanket and fumble for clothing. curse the cold air. rub our eyes in agony. lose touch with good friends. slice our skin open. struggle to see objects in the distance. feel guilty for saying no to plans. experience internal conflict. play video games. yearn to win. mourn every loss. resist accepting pain. take out your hairtie and put it back in. grow out your hair. cut it shorter. eat a piece of grapefruit. grow mushrooms. feed your chickens. hug your chicken close to your chest and kiss her back. fear for the world. fear for your future safety. cry. whistle. turn off the light. complain about work. complain about people. talk about mutual friends. reminisce on old times. reread childhood favorites. film snippets of life. put them together to make silly short films. cry again. scream in rage. wail in confusion. feel concerned about being heard. being a weirdo. being percieved as wrong. worry and worry more. 
and no matter what we do we age and we tiptoe towards the edge. and then everything we know is gone. yep.
