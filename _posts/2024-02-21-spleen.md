why are you so keen  
to be a machine  
youll rupture your spleen  
to capture the green     
try as you might   
we all lose the fight  
your grip is tight  
but no match for the night  
stop pretending   
its never ending   
tireless spending   
purpose pending   
looking for drama  
yet desperate to sleep  
a little bit longer   
the tension runs deep
