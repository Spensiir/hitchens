We sit at around the dinner table. My dad says his nonsense. My mom nods in annoyance. The food tastes good. My throat tightens. I take a deep breath, then sigh. My mom looks at me, concerned, afraid. I notice a spark of anger. Say something. I'm not alright. I'm displaying that I am not alright. Say something please. Notice that I am not alright. Please. Ask me what's wrong. Please. Please. Please. I sigh. She looks. Does nothing. I grow angrier. I help clean up the table. I leave. My dad starts scrolling on tiktok. My mom finishes cleaning up. Everyone is dissapointed. I feel bad. 

Again and again and again. The same thing. Raised by adults who never graduated from childhood. Raised by human creatures who aged physically but not mentally. "Caretaken" by adults who float through life in fear, wrapped in layers of spikes to protect themselves from demons that have long died. 

I am a child that needs to be held close even when his mother is barbed like the stem of a rose. I yearn more than most to be held with motherly tenderness and embraced with fatherly devotion. Because I did not get it yet. And everyone needs it. Babies cry for it, they have no shame in demanding it. They are the perfect creatures to bathe with affection. We usually trip over ourselves to dote on them with their soft and pudgy limbs and giant eyes. 

I think as we grow a little older, it becomes a bit more complicated to love us. We become a little more adultlike. We have more complex feelings and thoughts. To a parent with unresolved traumas, we become triggers. 

I triggered my parents in some way that caused them to halt their love for me. I could never understand at the moment except something was going very wrong. Why are they shouting at me? hitting me? ignoring me? The developing brain hopelessly ponders in a dual effort to escape the onging pain of the present. 

All I wanted was to be cared for as I needed at that point in my life. It's not easy but I was so sensitive. I felt the world without inhibition. I felt fear like death was a shark beneath my feet. I felt joy like heaven lived right inside my heart. In times of excitement I wanted someone to share my spark with. In times of terror I yearned for refuge in a trustworthy adult. 

I used to beg my mom to sleep in her room when I was scared. She would repeatedly reject and reject me. No, the bed is too small. I have work tomorrow. Your fear is less important than my comfort and my need to work the next day. 

Oh the rejection. The fear and the abandonment. I wailed and wailed and no one came. 

And now, I have given up. And she has sensed it and she is confused and hurt. I have decided that I longer need her even though I still want the idea of her. And that was part of her sadistic sense of safety in the world. Because she was never equipped to be a mother yet always expected herself to rise to the occasion. She probably harbors so much shame and fear for being found out as a bad parent so when I came to her over and over again despite her failures, she could use that pattern to convince herself that she was doing something right.

The tragedy is that everything is true. Layers and layers of tragedy. What could be more tragic than when a parent fails her child. When a child suffers like I did. So full of joy and excitement only to be ignored. So susceptible to fear and dissapointment only to be left to deal with it alone. It's like falling off a cliff for a decade straight. It's like swallowing a hornet that does not die. It's like not wanting to live sometimes, even when he knows that life is a gift. It's wanting to give up even though he knows there IS love in the world. It's like getting crushed by something massive. It's like dying just as he is about to taste life. 

I was living a nightmare. I could not escape. I was not in a body that had the power to help itself and I was ALONE. So early in life I lived in a nightmare. I feel like the best times of my life have been ripped away from me so I feel so much pressure to make the future perfect. I already missed out on so much. 

I think a terrible side effect of a nightmare childhood is one believes life is either unbearably painful and lonely, or by contrast, perfect and painless. When in reality, life has been and always will be something in between. But when life starts off horrifically, he feels owed something amazing in return. He remembers his early life as an entirely hellish experience, when there were many experiences of joy yet. There was something terrible taken from him: trust in people, proper emotional nurture, and a sense of belonging. There were also terrible things thrust onto him: generational fears and an overfed inner critic. These terrible things weigh him down as he grasps for things to help him grow. 

If only I can tell him that he has already begun to shed the poisononous burdens that were never his. That he is already collected so many materials he needs to grow. He has already grown. He is already doing a good job. He is already making us proud. And that I'm sorry it was so hard and confusing. That I wish I could have been there to make things easier. That actually I am here. He's doing so well. He is brave for following his heart even though it has been battered blue. He is smart and agile. He is bursting with vibrant energy. His voice is beautiful. His knack for music is a gift. His intensity is infectious and his way with words is enviable. He is quick and witty and sensitive. He is tenacious. He can access a layer of this world that not many can and it makes him so much more beautiful and interesting to be around. He doesn't hear genuine compliments enough. Even when he does he doesn't let himself feel it. It's so foreign. It scares him. It's okay. I'll stick around even if he doesn't want me to. I'll help even when he doesn't ask for it. I'll never let my love run dry. And I could not be happier any other way. He has my entire heart.
