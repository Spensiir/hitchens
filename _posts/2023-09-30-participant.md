life punches us square in the face before we even get in the arena. except we’re always in an arena and the floor is about to shatter for us to fall through - into the next. 

for a while now i’ve been trying to opt out through meditation. finding somewhere quiet where no one can disturb you. somewhere that feels safe from the world. then, sit back and just notice. just notice. just notice. no action. just observation. 

i took this mentality too far because it felt so good. it made me feel like i didn’t have to engage with life ever again as long as i could find a place to meditate. it made me feel safe because it reduced my needs down to nearly nothing - merely a place to sit in peace. there was something so so so alluring about that fantasy. divorcing with ego so much that i feel content spending the rest of my minutes learning of the breath. 

and then the body gets hungry and the mind gets existential. the body gets cold and thirsty and sleepy. the mind wants security and meaning and a sense of growth. eventually - the knuckles of biology start knocking and i’m ripped apart.

i thought all i needed to do was observe. i thought i would never need to take action again. to take action would be to risk something. it would mean giving up energy. to engage with the vortex of society and individual needs - it terrifies me. 

maybe i needed to take this slower, quieter detour inward - because i can see the cut of me that shivers better than ever. some time ago i pulled off the bandages covering my mind’s eye and blinked.

the ground is cracking more and more like it always does. im about to fall through. this time i hope to participate.
