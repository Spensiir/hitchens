I'm going to die. You're going to die. It took me a full year of squatting on that thought to even begin to accept it. 

A life is finite. 

There is not enough time or energy to live every possible iteration of a life. We can only exist in one location at a time. Skills can be honed for a lifetime and we only have one. 

This fact floored my entire world approximately 587 times so, if you're feeling sick to your stomach and dizzy in the head - I am completely with you.

At this point, however, it's a pill I hope to swallow every day. Because its after swallowing when I see the more approachable world that lives within the finite lifetime. 

I can place my two feet on the floor, lean forward, flex my buttocks and abdominal muscles, and push into the ground to arrive in a standing position. I can maneuver my body to turn towards the front door and I can reach out my hand to twist the knob and pull the door towards me. I can push off my right foot and pull my left leg upwards and forwards to cross the threshold of the doorframe. I can step outside. I can feel the sun tickle my cheek. I can notice the social anxiety tightening around my throat. I can ask my core to engage and my diaghram to compress and my lungs to expand. I can sense cool air rushing into my body. Then out. In. Then out. I can notice my awareness swirling away like the smoke of a candle just unlit. I can harness the new wave of awareness and ask him, what do you want to do next? 

And he'll say: "I'm scared. I don't want to die. I don't want to feel pain. I want to feel safe. I want to feel excited. I want to feel accomplished." 

I'll respond: "Of course baby. I hear you." as I squeeze him close to my breast. 

And then we'll take it from there.
