there's something slippery about pain and pleasure  
there seems to be something immutable about my dislike of pain  
it hurts and i would prefer to avoid it, minimize it, quickly move past it  
but when "it" is present, it seems that i am "it"  
to treat pain like a pest to be avoided feels like trying to avoid life itself  
which feels impossible and silly  
so it seems i simply must experience pain if i want to live fully  
here then is the allure of living partially  
why not live only the parts that feel pleasure?  
and what is fullness anyways?   
presence for the shifts of experience no matter the quality of the experience?  
the feeling of lost control and immensity of flow is nearly pain itself  
the response to why not be awake only to the pleasurable portions of life is:  
pain simply cannot be escaped  
it will poison one's sense of pleasure in its natural need to be felt  
one's life will turn grey  
instead, one can be open to both pain and pleasure  
this life looks more colorful   
which approach is preferable is to be experimented on  
and decided according to each individual's preference  
my personal experiments pull me towards a colorful life  
which opened the door to a new conundrum: decision-making  
so pain and pleasure will exist   
and i choose to meet both as they arise in their natural alternating pattern  
coming from a mindset that largely made decisions to avoid pain  
in other words, as a person emerging from the grey life  
i find myself feeling shockingly conscious about the decision making process  
or perhaps a decision making process that is more complex  
a process that factors in more than avoiding pain  
and chasing pleasure  
because both will arrive as a product of living  
independent of my interaction with the world  
it is intrinsic to human biology  
what is my new heuristic?  
depth of sensation?  
exploration of new sensations?  
connection?  
interest?  
achievement?  
healing?
