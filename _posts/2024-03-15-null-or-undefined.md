for so long i was afraid of death. i wrote today that the tidal wave of death renders all sense of meaning null. it reminded me of how in software development, variables will often be assigned the value null or undefined. i always struggled with knowing which to use. they seemed interchangeable to me. turns out their not. null is used when we know the value of that variable will always be nothing while undefined is used when we don't know what the value will be. if we use undefined, it could be null or it could be literally anything. thats when i realized. the tidal wave of death renders all sense of meaning undefined. i actually have no idea what happens after my body stops breathing and pumping blood through my veins. i can make guesses but that's all they are: imaginations. the deeper truth is everything that has yet to happen is undefined. the next minute, the next day, the next fourty years. they all share the property of being completely out of my knowledge. undefined. unknown. the core ingredient for fear but also excitement. what a silly tradeoff.
