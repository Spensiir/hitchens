something just happened that really really confused me.

i woke up feeling a litte confused about what I wanted to do. also not very well rested because I had such intense dreams.

i felt unsure what i should do and i felt a faint longing to be choraled happily by the forces of people. 

i read some wisdom of insecurity. it was really interesting. it was a bit hard to fully understand and i had to read things twice often.

the toilet in your bathroom has been making a lot of noise so i bought this new plug that could help.

guilt guilt guilt guilt guilt guilt guilt guilt

i should have bought it. i should have fixed it a long time ago. 

i didnt want to. i didnt want to. what kind of son doesnt want to help his own mother. a son who was not raised by a kind and caring mother. what a tragedy. i still have appease her to live in their home though. because the world is cruel. where else would i live?

i played music after reading and getting out of bed.

it was really nice. I heard them coming home. 

the basement flooded again. i didnt know. i was excited to share my progress in piano. i was excited they would say "i heard you learning a new song! and you did so well learning the first part."

instead i was caught in the usual whirlpool of guilt and confusion. i can't remember exactly what she said. just that i said ok ill do it so instinctively. so out of my awareness. it felt like the opposite of freedom. it felt manipulative but at the hands of my own mother? how cruel can the world be? 

so confused so confused and certainly hurt. in pain. something hurt it hurt it hurt but i didn't know why and i begged for it not to be my own mother. so i looked outside and she noticed me check out. 

i am angry. i've been angry and it didn't turn out well. it never turns out good to be angry. because she cannot absorb anger and my fathers anger was too much. so anger has no place in this house. i need to release it. ill go to kincaid woods today. 

dont even try to help me now you failed me too many times and i KNOW it'll only devolve into a pity party for yourself. more manipulation of my sympathy. so the only path forward is acceptance? acceptance that my own mother would drown me? no no no no no no how could that be?

how could that be? how could this be? that's so cruel. that is too cruel please do not be true. 

what is TRUE? if my own mother hurts me than what is true in this world? what is right? what is good if my own mother drowns me. 

I HAVE to fight for myself. my anger flares i blow past her and her drama begins again. how cruel is this world to subject me to a conflict like this. to pick between a possibly healthy relationship with someone new or a toxic one with my own blood. it is grey. it is grey. it is not  colorful. it is grey grey grey grey grey. it is not colorful.

she follows me to my room. what did I say wrong? what did i say wrong she asks. 

im shocked. the world is too cruel. still she is concerned about her own moral standing. she STILL has not reached a point where she can feel genuine concern for ME. it's still. all. about. her. and not about her own son. she can only understand another person's pain when it makes her feel wrong. and then of course anger and further manipulation pours out later.

i say. no i dont want to talk. she forces it out of me. im trapped. i want someone to listen but i know she cant. i want the idea of her but she is just her. 

i tell her something close to the truth. she begins to apologize but quickly goes back to explaining herself. then explaining how she will improve in rigid robotic steps. shut up. 

she said
" i will do everything on my own from now on. "

" i will not ask for your help anymore "

" if you need something from me then you just ask me "

i'm enraged at this point. i yell 

"WHY ARE you telling me this? i dont need to hear your plan just do it?"

but im confused. im so confused already that is why i yell ?
what is going on ? why is she saying this to me ? it's her defense mechanism. she cannot simply be with the pain of guilt realized. she has to fling it outwards via shaming others for letting her self-punishing.

but why would i ever want anyone to self punish? this is the great confusion. i do not want her to suffer. i wanted love and I DIDNT GET IT AND i'm angry at that loss and i blame her. i blame her and i trick myself into thinking i want her to suffer but in reality i am STILL suffering and she is still not enough to allieve my pain.

who is? that is the question?

but the other part of the confusion is then who the hell am i living with? what is my role in this family? where is the balance? all relationships feel bad when they are out of balance? but a parent child relationship is designed to be imbalanced. but she was not ready to give , nor was my father. so i feel owed so much attention and care and nurture and i feel old anger rise up when they ask me for MORE before giving what i am owed. and here is the root of the angry confusion: the main way my mother extracted "value" from child me was through shaming manipulation, while my father used violence to exploit my fear. My mother used shame to exploit my empathy and my father used violence to exploit my instinct to survive. 

parts of my identity that i could not bear to sacrafice as a developing creature. parts of identity only a cruel world would ask for before anyone is ready. but who is ever truly ready to give such things up. i know those parts of me are not me because they were robbed of me and i am still here. 

what to do now? i cannot resist my anger. i cannot resist my guilt. i cannot resist my confusion. i cannot resist pain despite all the pain i've already felt. 

i must have gained something. clarity. that i must leave. that they are young. and trapped. and their abuse is self-abuse and does not have to hurt me. that my pain is more loss than anything else. longing for nurture more than momentary violence. the fear of loss of life persists as i still am not certain i can make it without them. without their physical support. 

another tragedy. to have to navigate such a thing on ones own. fuck. fuck. 

i think that is the final piece of it all. that i fear for suffering in the elements. and their opinions of me affect such risk. but that is always outside of my control. it always has been. if it happens i must jump into the fire, or in my case into the cold. i grow tired of the old vicious pains. i do not know the future. i do not know the past. i tire of these patterns.
