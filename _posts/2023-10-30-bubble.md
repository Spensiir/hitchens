Bubbly bubbly bloom around me ~ break my day into bounty.

Let’s assume attention is a single-unit, multi-track mechanism - meaning a person can focus on one activity at a time but can switch the target of focus at will. 

Let’s also say the underlying goal for a human is to achieve goals. 

As such, we can see the human experience as a series of time bubbles each representing a person’s focus upon a certain activity for a varying length of time. 

This morning, as I was finishing up a gaming session, I felt an upcoming shift in what my body would engage with next. Sometimes, when change approaches I’m torn into a million pieces trying to hit a target state far into the future. 

Thinking of the next step as a time bubble creates a container that I can leap onto - one that is both momentous and safe due to its intentional and temporary nature. 

It is also a powerful way to break down larger tasks into smaller pieces via time bubbles.
