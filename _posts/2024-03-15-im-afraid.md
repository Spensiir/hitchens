im afraid. im scared. im so so so scared. im scared of dying. of getting cut. of breaking a bone. of getting burned. of getting yelled at. of being so poor i can't afford food. of having so little money that i need to beg for a place to sleep. im scared. i am i am i am. its real. its so so so real. 

im scared of not having enough money. because i don't want to die. i dont want to suffer the shame of being seen as poor and lazy and useless. im terrified. it grips me the fear. im afraid im not fit to exist in this world. im afraid im far too weak and stupid and just built wrong.

im so scared. i am so so so scared. i swear i am. i am so so so so scared. i want to hide forever. i want to be hidden from anyone and everything so nothing can ever hurt me.
