for so long the part of me that craves security and fears uncertainty was given disproportionate space in the center stage. and a disproportionate burden. this imbalance poisoned my connection to my senses and the world for years and years until it reached a crescendo at an office job two years ago. the part of me that needed to feel alive, not just be living, could not bear being deprioritized any longer. i left that job and tried some other kinds of work. 

it wasn't suddenly smooth sailing. the world opened up too quickly. i felt overwhelmed. and the forces that overburdened the part of me that needs enough security (and dismissed the part of me that needs enjoyment) did not suddenly disappear. they represented voices from my parents, voices born from emotional neglect, and voices from the wider culture. and they manifested in my body as a coalition of shame and fear.

and somewhere in this new internal struggle where my voices of shame and fear are also demanding to be heard is where i currently am today. 

it has not been clean. it has not been comfortable. it has been messy and terrifying but sometimes in an exhilarating way. i experimented with revealing parts of myself that i have kept under wraps for my entire life. it felt really good. it felt healing in a way that self-care has never been. 

it has been so hard to feel whole. my circumstances tore me apart and threw the pieces in different directions. i've long felt like it would be impossible for the different parts of myself to coexist, not to mention feel like i belong in the world at large and with other people. i felt like i had to choose between feeling alive or being alive. and between a sense of autonomy or feeling connected with other people. 

my takeaway is this:
i cannot pick and choose parts of myself if i want to live a life of wellbeing and i cannot expect to resolve internal conflict without practicing indiscriminate inner compassion. and maybe my most groundbreaking realization is that i can fucking talk about myself and "take up space" in conversation with my close friends. and that it's part of a healthy relationship and it's probably not trauma dumping. and that expressing myself vulnerably will not feel natural for a long time. so alongside loads of acceptance for that discomfort is a new honoring for how massively important it is for me to have that experience with my close friends. 

with care,
