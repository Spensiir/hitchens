There are two modes I embody the most. 
The first is video game mode. Life is a very detailed video game. The goal is to make desires come true. There are limited resources. There are many arenas and maps. There are billions of other players. Players often team up to pursue objectives together. The primary goal is to avoid death. Other top priorities are to achieve one's fullest potential, to enjoy a variety of impactful experiences, and to contribute to a legacy. 
The second is cinema mode. We are highly sensitive beings experiencing a chain reaction of thoughts, emotions, sensations, and perceptions. The objective is to expand one's view of the elements that arise in the stream of consciousness, then to deepen such connections.
