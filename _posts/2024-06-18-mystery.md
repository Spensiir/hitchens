look closely. peel back all the layers. anybody can see the truth.

we are not in control. at best we can see just one grain of sand. right has left and wrong is to our right. 

memories ground us just as they confine us. how did you get here? it feels like a dream doesn't it?

without memories nothing blocks our view of constant arrival into the moment. 

the relative world will play on with all her fanfare and stories. you will identify with your body and mind. you will cling to stories of logic and continuity, for bathing too long in the truth is maddening. 

me too. here and there i might dip my toes into the mysterious waters. perhaps a limb or leg and yet

i will scream when they murder my family.

i will despair at my mortality.

i will sink into beautiful sounds. 

and i will not forget the mystery of the moment where we must all belong.
