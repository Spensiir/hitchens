derek and bosco on a boat

derek dreams of a bigger boat

with colorful sails and 12 new cannons

bosco is busy sealing the holes

their boat scraped a rock last night

derek is livid, as the boat gets not bigger

bosco is exhausted still tries to meet his demands

he toils and toils then storms off in rage

you do some work then come talk to me

derek is shocked 

he's drained from his thinking

how will we grow without my dreams

without them we're just robots

im already turning into a robot

a tool for your desires

i too have feelings and wishes and needs

im sorry i got lost in my own world

i wasn't taught to coexist with 

wait who are you again ?

i'm not sure derek, i truly am not

i just know i have a body 

that senses this world 

and can play in it too

i guess if i take a step back,

i dont really know who i am either

i think and weave stories

i feel but not quite like you do

i worry and reminisce

i plan and hope and dream
