this is how the experience of unsatisfying work perpetuates the narrative of emotional neglect.  

work. give yourself in exchange for resources.  
you have to do it to survive.  

just like childhood. please your parents. do not upset them and you will be safe. suppress your own nuances. your personality. your desires. your pain. just get through it. pay the price for life. other people's demands come first. satisfy other peoples' desires before your own. you must for the sake of survival. there are no other options. it is a cruel world. no one cares about you beyond what you can provide them. love is staying alive. love is physical resources.
