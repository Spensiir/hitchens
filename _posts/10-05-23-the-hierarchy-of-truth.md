We are born and then we continuously absorb the world through a suite of senses. Our biology wants to survive so we pay special attention to patterns that give us food and water or feelings of security. 

We have a vague concept that there is vastly more possibility than we are aware of and we also house a counteractive force that pushes us to focus on the options that are already familiar to us. 

If we peer closer at this dynamic, we see that everything we think we know is a pattern that, up until the current moment, works. However that pattern could easily cease to pay out as we expect considering the world has far more information we have yet to perceive.

Since so far, most humans perish before reaching one hundred years of continuous consciousness, it's been impossible to collect close to all the information even the earth has to offer. Without that possibility, we cannot expect to have the entire dataset of patterns to filter through and select the most reliable and consistent ones.  

As a result, it's extremely unlikely one could use brute force to arrive at a god-like certainty of truth. 

Since we cannot sift through all data, we can only be selective about our attention and energy. We can track our progress and update our beliefs as we collect more information. We can maintain two hierarchies, one to order the slices of the world that deserve our focus and another that maps the reliability of the patterns we have collected so far. 

I have brainstormed some strategies that seem to maximize our chances of approaching a more reliable truth that work within the biological limits of a human lifetime. 

one is to rely on our irrational desires like a compass to direct our attention
two is direct experience with the world
three is intaking high quality indirect interpretations of the world
four is maintaining an organized repository of current state of knowledge and to update such frequently
five is to journal a lot
six is to ask clever people good questions   
seven is to accept the pusuit will never be perfect or complete
