I have started to notice a tendency for people, including myself, to try and handle every issue that arises in a "healthy" way. Great; A+! I mean, who doesn't want more time and a better time to be alive. Healthiness is just so undeniably better. As such, it makes perfect sense why when someone in our lives does something harmful, something "unhealthy," we leap to feet and yowl at the top of our lungs. What you just did is wrong, "unhealthy." And that gives us all the right to reduce you to a villain who should be dismissed and discarded. 

Except how can we learn what is healthy when we are shamed into the seventh layer of hell for doing anything otherwise? Who even gets to decide what is healthy and what isn't? If the goal is to label a person's action healthy or unhealthy, a binary, does the endeavor not boil down to a mere vote? 

I for one would prefer to live in a world where I can make mistakes and not risk getting rioted out of the community. So what am I suggesting, to allow any and all actions to play out as people desire? That's insane! But that's exactly what I am suggesting. That's life anyways. I'd rather die having experienced all the excitement my path has potential for than die a bored man a little bit later. And it's not just about excitement, it's about growth. Stability sets the stage for growth but conflict is what drives it. We can have all the healing alms in the world but without fuel, we are just a juiced up seed that never sprouts.
