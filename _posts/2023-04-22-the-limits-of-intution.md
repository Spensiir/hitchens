  i recently went on a trip. i flew to san francisco to stay with a pair of close friends. then i drove to palo alto to see one of my oldest childhood friends. afterwards, i flew to san bernardino to start a camping roadtrip journey with another pair of close friends.  

when i first arrived, i quickly noticed a sudden lack of fixation on time. it had been a long time since i felt so engaged with my company.  

it was tough at times.  

i was always on someone else's property. my temporary space for safe sleep, leisure, and food preparation rested upon the sway of another person's purchasing power. i was continuously protected by the generosity of another individual, by the half-spoken agreement that my friends would provide my basic living needs for a set amount of time. i had chosen to trust in their ability and willingness to honor my needs.   

it was tough because i often felt anxious. my temporary safety banked on the goodwill of another person. i relinquished control. all i could do is ask and trust. the anxiety was less about their ability to provide my needs, and more about the potential unspoken resentment that might build up each time i ask for something they'd rather not provide but feel obliged to under the vague social laws of hosting. an anxiety that every question layers further weight on the camel's back until one final request leads to an eruption of conflict and violence and shame.   

i let myself feel the anxiety. i related compassionately to that feeling. yes, i am feeling that. a spiky lump in my throat and a flat pressure against my chest. yes, this feeling is painful; unpleasant at the very least. yes, i have a part of me that feels afraid. yes, there is a future where such an outcome is real. yes, that would be really painful to experience.  

then the feeling fades.  

the soulful conversations. the dancing. the walking. the hiking. the beauty of nature. the shared meals. the gift giving. the laughter. the activities and the dress up. the emotions. the swirling energy. the sunlight. the characters. the presence of relatable, interesting people. the commotion. the sleep.   

the sense of community.   

it was easy to act on intuition. i had capable loving logical strong human companions to catch me in case something goes wrong. i would be there for them in the same way. there was social insurance. the most dynamic and reassuring safety net imagineable.   

and now im back. my parents are out on a trip. i am home alone with my cat. my community is suddenly fraught and spread thin like a worn sweater stretched so that it covered an entire soccer field. the gaps feel massive and the net more like an unexpected strand here and there.   

i try to carry over the bliss of letting intuition take rein. it's so. much. harder. my body resists with all it's might. intuition herself tells me not to trust her. intuition herself tells me her power lies in the enviroment of community. logic is tired but feels reliable. he has dealt with the dramas of lonesome before. he feels familiar, even as we are all dipping into dissapointment.   

i thought i had turned a new leaf. a breakthrough into the land of trust and intuitive decision making. a fairy world where the universe is wholly on my side. maybe so but it no longer feels safe to live exclusively in such a land.
