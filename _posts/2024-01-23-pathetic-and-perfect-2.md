Part one ended off with the following questions.

Where can we find people who can help us? What do they look like? And how do we prepare ourselves to be open their help?

I feel most connected to the second question. In my head. They look like a village. Everyone invested in my growth. Loving attention from a rotating selection of personalities and ages. The constant is each person sees a real part of me and nourishes me with excitement. No single person shifts gears just as I do, but there is always someone who catches me. 

There is less pain. Simply put. There is less pain from loneliness. There are cushions, as my friend would say. There is FLOW. It is refreshing. It is comforting. It is invigorating. To be a part of a loving beast. To belong. 

From where we are right now, how can we move closer to such a situation?


I think the youth are meant to be unstable and inconsistent. Of course they are. They are raw. They experience the world as it arises with no gap. They do not self-edit. And people are made of many different parts that arise one after the other when we develop. It's scary to grapple with so many different parts, so I must have looked to someone for stability. But I had no caretaker that felt stable. Let alone a caretaker that explicitly recognized the arrival of my many beautiful different parts. So not only was I alone in meeting my parts, I was often shamed for showing them. Now I know that I am them, all of them. But still, I have not moved too far from where I was as a child. Confused as to how to exist with so many different personalities? Afraid to be around people because I was shamed with being inconsistent even though it was developmentally normal. Lonely because I self-isolate our that fear.

What are simply easy steps I can take to nourish myself away from this cycle? It is not evil, it is the best safety I could muster at the time.
