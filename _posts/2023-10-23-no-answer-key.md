There is no answer key to the decisions thrust upon us. 

A recently widowed wife, a war refugee, a middle school bully, an alcoholic veteran, a traumatized author, a successful business owner. They all breathe air, operate a body, experience emotions, and walk the same earth.

They lived life like so ten years ago and they will continue to live as such ten years from today. 

No matter what decisions they make, they will seek food, relieve themselves, desire companionship, and fantasize upon the future. 

So why do anything if the core process never changes? 

Because obligation, expectation, desire, boredom, fear, curiosity, and ambition. Because we either have enough and we want something more or different or we donâ€™t have enough and we want enough. 

Whatever position we feel ourselves in, no action will cause major change. Not even death.
