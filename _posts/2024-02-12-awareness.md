awareness awareness
who are you
i can’t remember the beginning of this life
i don’t know what happens after
im somewhere in the middle
hopefully towards the beginning
you gave me this body 
that needs material 
you gave me this mind
who needs attention
this world is confusing 
is fun
is full
too full
and still so many other bodies and minds
how could it be 
that i can only see the world through these eyes
through these thoughts
through this skin
through these memories
through this imagination
when there is so much more
so many people
what is the point of it all ?
what is the point of having this awareness
this responsibility to persist if it is destined to end 
to eat and maybe fight
to take care of myself and other people
is it for the moments of peace and joy
is it for the moments of excitement or achievement
or the moments of realization
all moments trickling away
rushing in
passing by
passing by
my body persist
my memories persist
my pain persists
my desires keep coming
my body my body this body
it does not dissipate like a gas does
it does not dissolve 
it does not melt into the world and lose its identity
i am not like a rushing river
not exactly
i have hands that remember how to play piano
i have legs that know how to jump
it has skills
it has memories
it has relationships
it has hope
it wants to love
to feel good
to be something new 
to carry forth his core to a new place 
it will always be unsure
why
or how
always always
mystery like a black hole
and it will be frustrating many a times
maybe it can be soothing
i will accept
i must
because i want to feel good 
again and again
and again
until
good night !
