my sense of community  
is like a wool sweater  
stretched over a stadium  
each thread dozens of feet apart  
the sweater has lost  
any ability to keep me warm  
no matter how i look at it  
the root of the issue is that  
the people i cared about, left  
before they were physically distant  
now they are also emotionally distant  
it was so silly and i saw it coming  
to think human bonds can survive  
such separation and length  
the digital promise was a lie  
the spirit of adventure had a cost  
so here i am  
resentment gnawing at my throat  
confusion brewing in my chest  
trying to make do with what i have  
the process of rebuilding community  
starts off in loneliness
