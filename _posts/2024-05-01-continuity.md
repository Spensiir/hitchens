a cup of water left on the desk is still there the next morning. 

my mind wants to be a person who rises early to achieve many goals. my body usually wants to cacoon in the warm bed until wakefulness pours over the brim.

a body feels and wants in a seamless flow. it suffers when it is ignored, yet it is a herculean feat of focus to continuously experience consciousness. 

i want to let my body lead more often. the mind resists. he says that it is not wise in this world built on thinking and planning. this conflict is consciousness now. it see it. i am it.
