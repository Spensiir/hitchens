the emotionally neglected  
never had trustworthy caretakers  
and still don't  
they are only understood by those  
who also have holes in their hearts  
and so have little to spare  
while those with steady warmth  
who always knew care  
cannot empathize  
it is a confusing place to be  
lonely and draining  
like a fallen bud
