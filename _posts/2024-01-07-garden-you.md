I’m reading Alan Watt’s *The Wisdom of Insecurity*, where he dissects the modern human mechanism for interpreting time. Watts discourages allotting large doses of energy and space towards planning. He argues that it is a common practice for man to live in narratives born from expecting memories to play out as they once did, and that such a practice is unfortunate because it traps us in a lesser reality created by our over-strained brains. Instead, we can strive to recognize that our existence is a vivid process of complex material. By doing so, Watts believes we allow our fleshy brains to cool down and return to equilibrium with the rest of his organ siblings. It seems to me that he thinks such a state is one of man’s greatest pleasures, if not the starting point for them. 

I feel deep resonance with his words and also some dissonance. I called out of work this morning and I immediately felt a sharp uptick in feelings of guilt and relief which drained my sense of certainty yet fulfilled my desire for freedom. Later, as I watered my houseplants and folded laundry, I felt my sense of restlessness fall while my desire to create rose. Now, as I write I think to myself -

It feels appropriate to see myself like a garden full of diverse flora. As I tend to one organism, others desire more attention. Often I can nourish many creatures at once, like playing sports with friends might satisfy my need for exhilaration, fitness, and connection altogether. Some creatures grow on opposite corners of the garden, making it close to impossible to help simultaneously, like rest and activity. 

I think my sense of dissonance stems from believing that our brain's tendency to use memories for prediction, creating Watt’s “lesser reality,” is actually one of its greatest contributions to our body. It evolved alongside the diversification of our gardens and is actually designed to create flows of actions that best satisfy the many critters we house. 

I do not think I am at odds with Mr. Watts and his dissatisfaction with how brainy our collective consciousness has grown. I actually very much agree with his assertions. If anything, I would like this reflection to be another step along the path he trods - but one that takes special care to honor the brain and his primal ingenuity. Perhaps with genuine recognition of the brain, we can coax it closer to a state of primordial function and as a result, lead our bodies toward greater joys.
